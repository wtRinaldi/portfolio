What Drives Me
::

::Paragraph
Before entering the tech industry, I spent over a decade working in high-end audio/video and residential automation. That environment introduced me to programming and honed my technical problem-solving skills—laying the groundwork for a smooth transition into web development.
::

::Paragraph
After earning my degree from Penn State and graduating from the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program, I immersed myself in the world of modern front-end frameworks. Vue.js and Nuxt.js quickly became my tools of choice.

Why Vue and Nuxt
::

::Paragraph
Vue’s clean syntax and reactive data binding make it a joy to use, while Nuxt adds structure, scalability, and server-side rendering. Together, they allow me to build responsive, performant applications that exceed client and user expectations.

My Approach
::

::Paragraph
I aim to deliver more than just a product—I create polished, thoughtful experiences. I pay close attention to detail, design with responsiveness in mind, and ensure that every interface is both functional and visually engaging across all devices.
::

::Paragraph
Inspired by the principles in *Clean Code*, I focus on writing maintainable, scalable code that supports long-term success and minimizes technical debt.

Continuous Learning
::

::Paragraph
Technology moves fast—and I’m always learning. Whether it’s new features in Vue, emerging design systems, or improving accessibility, I’m constantly pushing myself to stay current and sharpen my craft.

Mentoring
::

::Paragraph
As a former Udacity mentor, I reviewed over 2,100 student projects and was recognized as a top performer. I love helping others grow their skills and understand core front-end concepts. I take pride in being someone teammates—junior or senior—can count on.
