What Drives Me

My venture into web development was preceded by a decade of immersion in the high-end audio-video and residential automation industry.
This field served as my initial introduction to programming and demanded comparable technical problem-solving abilities.
Transitioning into Front End development felt like a natural progression from my prior career, where crafting captivating experiences stood as the central objective.
