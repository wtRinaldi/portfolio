Using content components to style markdown

::Paragraph
When first getting acquainted with Nuxt content, I was a bit unclear on how to apply styles to content.
::

::Paragraph
I couldn't find much information on the subject of adding styles to Nuxt Content but did come across a YouTube video suggesting to apply styles to the files using the 'ContentDoc' or 'ContentRender' components.
This would be where you would be rendering the individual markdown file.
The creator of the video correctly noted that the scoped style tag will not work and to apply styles with CSS ':deep' selector.
This works, but it's not a very pleasant developer experience.
There is a much simpler way.

::Paragraph
Enter Nuxt Content components.  
::

::Paragraph 
Nuxt Content allows for us to create content specific components in our regular component directory by adding a /content folder in our /components directory.
Simply create slotted components that style your markdown content, complete with scoped CSS or tailwind classes, and consume them in markdown.

::ContentH2
/components/content MainTitle.vue component used to style the title on this page
::

::CodeBlock
```vue
<template>
    <div class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-light py-6">
        <slot />
    </div>
</template>
```

Using the component in the markdown file
::

::CodeBlock
```markdown
::MainTitle
 How to style Nuxt Content markdown files
::
```
::

::CodeDescription
Use two colons ::ComponentName as an opening tag before your content and two colons :: after your content as a closing tag.
This passes the content between the tags to the slot.
::

::Paragraph
Now you're free to use scoped styles or Tailwind classes as you would expect in the content component.
::

::Paragraph
So far, I've created headers, subheaders, title, paragraph, and code block components to create this blog.
Styling your content becomes very easy after setting up some basic components.
