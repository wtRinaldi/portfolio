Relying on the strengths of others to get more done
::

::Paragraph
On my very first day as a Software Engineer contracted by Vanguard in SE PA, I found myself waiting in the hall for a meeting room to become available.
Being new, I stood alone, leaning against the wall, holding my notebook, across from the meeting room.
::

::Paragraph
Soon, my new and very talented engineering manager approached me, initiating a conversation with some small talk and welcoming me to the team. As our conversation concluded, he imparted some valuable words of advice that have stayed with me ever since: "If you want to get a lot done, leverage your team."

Reflecting on this moment, I realize the significance of these words chosen by my experienced senior manager to kickstart my career. But why were they so important?

First, what does "Leveraging your team" mean?
::

::Paragraph
"Leveraging your team" as a software engineer means effectively utilizing the skills, expertise, and diverse perspectives of your team members to achieve project goals. It entails assigning tasks based on individual strengths, fostering collaboration for problem-solving, and promoting knowledge sharing to enhance productivity and software quality. It also involves recognizing and appreciating each team member's contributions, ensuring effective communication channels, and empowering them to take ownership of their work.

In terms of Front End Development, it means understanding and utilizing your team's strengths and weaknesses. For example, if you have a developer strong in CSS, allocate tasks accordingly to meet tight deadlines.

However, it doesn't mean ignoring weaknesses. Rather, actions should be taken to develop your team's skill set. Encourage knowledge sharing and utilize successful code examples in retrospectives.

You're never alone

I view Software Engineering as the ultimate team endeavor. It requires the collective talents of individuals spanning various disciplines to create valuable applications. Being part of a team ensures you're never alone, especially in supportive company cultures. Juniors rely on senior developers for guidance and learning opportunities, while seniors benefit from leveraging juniors to accomplish tasks. In every scenario, collaboration and mutual reliance are essential components of success.
